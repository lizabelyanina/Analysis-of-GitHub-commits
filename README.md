# Repository Analysis Tool with Object-Centric Process Mining

A web-based tool that turns GitHub repository data into rich process mining insights using an object-centric approach. Perfect for understanding development patterns, contributor dynamics, and file lifecycles in your projects.

## üåü Key Features

- **Smart Commit Classification**: Automatically categorizes commits using either:
  - Direct parsing of conventional commits
  - ML-based classification for non-standardized commits (76.57% accuracy)
- **Object-Centric Process Mining**: Generates visualizations showing how files, developers, and activities interact
- **Comprehensive Analysis**:
  - Contributor collaboration patterns and clustering
  - File lifecycle analysis
  - Temporal activity patterns
  - Development workflow insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **Data Processing**: pandas, pm4py, pydriller
- **Machine Learning**: DistilBERT, PyTorch
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, networkx
- **Process Mining**: PM4Py with OCEL support

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

## üìä Analysis Outputs

The tool generates several types of insights:

- **Object-Centric Process Models**:
  - Directly-Follows Graphs (OCDFG)
  - Petri Nets (OCPN)
- **Temporal Analysis**:
  - Commit patterns over time
  - Activity heatmaps
- **Contributor Analysis**:
  - Collaboration networks
  - Developer clustering
- **File Analysis**:
  - Lifecycle durations
  - Activity distributions
  - Contributor distributions
